## Exercises
### Exercise 00: Give my BMI
- **Description**: This exercise involves creating functions to calculate BMI values from height and weight lists and to apply a limit to the BMI values.
- **Relevance**: It introduces the concepts of list manipulation and error handling in Python, which are essential for data processing tasks.

### Exercise 01: 2D Array
- **Description**: Write a function that takes a 2D array, prints its shape, and returns a truncated version of the array based on provided start and end arguments.
- **Relevance**: This exercise emphasizes the importance of understanding array dimensions and slicing techniques, which are fundamental in data manipulation.

### Exercise 02: Load My Image
- **Description**: Develop a function that loads an image, prints its format, and displays its pixel content in RGB format.
- **Relevance**: This exercise highlights the significance of image formats and pixel data representation, which are crucial for image analysis.

### Exercise 03: Zoom on Me
- **Description**: Create a program that loads an image, prints information about it, and displays it after zooming in on a specific area.
- **Relevance**: This exercise reinforces the understanding of image dimensions and pixel manipulation, as well as error handling when working with image data.

### Exercise 04: Rotate Me
- **Description**: Write a program that loads an image, cuts a square part from it, and transposes it to produce a new image.
- **Relevance**: This exercise teaches the concept of image transposition and the importance of manipulating image data for various applications.

### Exercise 05: Pimp My Image
- **Description**: Develop functions to apply various color filters to images while maintaining the original image shape.
- **Relevance**: This exercise provides insights into color manipulation and the application of filters, which are common tasks in image processing.

## Conclusion
This project has provided valuable insights into image processing and analysis using Python. The hands-on experience gained through various exercises has equipped me with essential skills for a career in data science and image analysis.
